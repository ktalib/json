Laravel's localization features provide a convenient way to retrieve strings in various languages, allowing you to easily support multiple languages within your application.

Laravel provides two ways to manage translation strings. First, language strings may be stored in files within the lang directory. Within this directory, there may be subdirectories for each language supported by the application. This is the approach Laravel uses to manage translation strings for built-in Laravel features such as validation error messages:

/lang
    /en
        messages.php
    /es
        messages.php

Or, translation strings may be defined within JSON files that are placed within the lang directory. When taking this approach, each language supported by your application would have a corresponding JSON file within this directory. This approach is recommended for applications that have a large number of translatable strings:

/lang
    en.json
    es.json
